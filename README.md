## Overview

peer-to-peer is a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate decentralized, real-time communication within distributed systems. It underpins scalable and resilient data exchange between nodes, supporting dynamic user interactions and presence awareness.

## Why peer-to-peer?

This project aims to enable developers to build secure, scalable peer-to-peer applications with core features such as:

### üß© **Decentralized Connectivity**
Supports direct interactions between nodes, ensuring resilient and scalable communication.

### üåê **Real-Time Messaging**
Leverages WebSocket integration for instant chat and data exchange.

### üë§ **User Presence Tracking**
Provides real-time online status updates and activity monitoring.

### üîß **Modular Architecture**
Built with Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Redis for flexible, maintainable development.

### üéØ **Web Interface**
Includes templates for chat rooms, user lists, and login, enhancing user engagement.

### üîí **Secure Data Persistence**
Ensures reliable message storage and retrieval across the network.
